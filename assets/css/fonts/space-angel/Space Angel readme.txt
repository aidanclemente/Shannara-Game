After nearly 15 years since my last font your friend and humble designer is back in action. This is my first one in a very long time. Unlike many of my previous "famous" fonts this one 
was plucked from the sky or shall we say the stars. The contours and pointy nature of Space Angel is sharp and futuristic with the X resembling a star. The # and " will give you an angel. The
capitals double as lowercase letters and there's limited punctuation because this wasn't designed to have a full character set.
